# Preface

Welcome to this book!

These are lecture notes for Data Science 701, _Tools 
for Data Science,_ as taught by me at Boston University.

This course has evolved from CS 506, which has major contributions from Evimaria Terzi,
George Kollios, and Lance Galletti.   Errors are mine.   (Please alert
me to errors -- or better yet, submit a pull request!).

## Format

The notes are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.   Demos and most figures
are included as executable Python code.   All course materials are in
the github repository
[here.](https://github.com/mcrovella/CS701-Tools-for-Data-Science)

Each Chapter is based on a single Jupyter notebook, and each notebook
forms the basis for one lecture (more or less).
